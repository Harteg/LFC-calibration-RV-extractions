### Overview: 

- Main functions for performing LFC calibrations are in calibration_functions.py 
- Main functions for performing radial velocity extractions are in radial_velocity_functions.py
- Poly-fit calibration is performed in calib_poly_fit.ipynb
- Cubic-spline interpolation calibration is performed and compared to poly-fit calibration in calib_interpolation.ipynb
- Radial velocity extractions are performed in RV_extractions.ipynb.
- RV_extra_plots.ipynb contains various plots

**Note:** A few LFC exposures are included in the dir expres_tp, while the star spectra data can be found (upon request) on the website for the [EXPRES Stellar-Signals Project](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/science/activity.php).
